# NCAA_Champion_Returns

## Project Overview

Early in the 2019 NCAAM Basketball season, UVA was struggling. In fact, they were in danger of not even making the March Madness tournament just a year removed from winning it all. Online, I was not able to find a list of teams to win the tournament and then not even make the tournament the following year. This quick project checks to see which NCAA Men's Basketball Champions returned to the tournament the next year and which ones didn't.

## Findings
Only a handful of teams fit the aforementioned case, it has certainly happened before but is rare.
